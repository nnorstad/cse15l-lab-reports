We can see here what it looks like to successfully log into ieng6. Usually, it will require password authentication, but during week 7 lab we configured our accounts so we no longer have to type in our passwords. To access the ssh command, I used the history keyword in the terminal as follows.
```
$ history | grep "ssh"
```
This command searched the command line history for all commands including ssh. The output of this command was a list of all the recent commands that included ssh, which allowed me to easily acceess my ieng6 username. Creating an ssh key and using the history keyword allows a user to login to ieng6 without needing to remember their username and password.
